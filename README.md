# NBIS site tools

This repo contains YML files that are to be displayed on the NBIS website.
The website runs Jekyll and the tool YMLs are stored in a collection.
The YML files are generated by running a script locally on a tool stub
JSON file, which is also stored here. This can be run on every tool update
and downloads the tool from [bio.tools](http://bio.tools), adding some
extra information.
